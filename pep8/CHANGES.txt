Changelog
=========


0.6.0 (2010-09-19)
------------------

* Test suite reorganized and enhanced in order to check more failures
  with fewer test files.  Read the ``run_tests`` docstring for details
  about the syntax.

* Fix E225: accept ``print >>sys.stderr, "..."`` syntax.

* Fix E501 for lines containing multibyte encoded characters. (Issue #7)

* Fix E221, E222, E223, E224 not detected in some cases. (Issue #16)

* Fix E211 to reject ``v = dic['a'] ['b']``. (Issue #17)

* Exit code is always 1 if any error or warning is found. (Issue #10)

* ``--ignore`` checks are now really ignored, especially in
  conjunction with ``--count``. (Issue #8)

* Blank lines with spaces yield W293 instead of W291: some developers
  want to ignore this warning and indent the blank lines to paste their
  code easily in the Python interpreter.

* Fix E301: do not require a blank line before an indented block. (Issue #14)

* Fix E203 to accept NumPy slice notation ``a[0, :]``. (Issue #13)

* Performance improvements.

* Fix decoding and checking non-UTF8 files in Python 3.

* Fix E225: reject ``True+False`` when running on Python 3.

* Fix an exception when the line starts with an operator.

* Allow a new line before closing ``)``, ``}`` or ``]``. (Issue #5)


0.5.0 (2010-02-17)
------------------

* Changed the ``--count`` switch to print to sys.stderr and set
  exit code to 1 if any error or warning is found.

* E241 and E242 are removed from the standard checks. If you want to
  include these checks, use switch ``--select=E,W``. (Issue #4)

* Blank line is not mandatory before the first class method or nested
  function definition, even if there's a docstring. (Issue #1)

* Add the switch ``--version``.

* Fix decoding errors with Python 3. (Issue #13 [1]_)

* Add ``--select`` option which is mirror of ``--ignore``.

* Add checks E261 and E262 for spaces before inline comments.

* New check W604 warns about deprecated usage of backticks.

* New check W603 warns about the deprecated operator ``<>``.

* Performance improvement, due to rewriting of E225.

* E225 now accepts:

  - no whitespace after unary operator or similar. (Issue #9 [1]_)

  - lambda function with argument unpacking or keyword defaults.

* Reserve "2 blank lines" for module-level logical blocks. (E303)

* Allow multi-line comments. (E302, issue #10 [1]_)


0.4.2 (2009-10-22)
------------------

* Decorators on classes and class methods are OK now.


0.4 (2009-10-20)
----------------

* Support for all versions of Python from 2.3 to 3.1.

* New and greatly expanded self tests.

* Added ``--count`` option to print the total number of errors and warnings.

* Further improvements to the handling of comments and blank lines.
  (Issue #1 [1]_ and others changes.)

* Check all py files in directory when passed a directory (Issue
  #2 [1]_). This also prevents an exception when traversing directories
  with non ``*.py`` files.

* E231 should allow commas to be followed by ``)``. (Issue #3 [1]_)

* Spaces are no longer required around the equals sign for keyword
  arguments or default parameter values.
